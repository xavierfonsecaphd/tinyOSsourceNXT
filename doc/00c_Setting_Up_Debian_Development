Installing a development environment on Debian based distributions.

Focuses on installing a msp430 based development environment but can
easily be adapted to other cpus by changing what toolchain gets 
installed.

Linux only.  In particular, Debian based (wheezy 7.5) or Ubuntu (12.04 and
later).


State:

2014-05-26:
    Migrated to Debian 7 (wheezy) and Ubuntu 12.04 through 14.04.  Tested
    on wheezy 7.5.0 and Ubuntu 12.04, 13.10 and 14.04.

    msp430 4.6.3 (msp430-46) toolchain used.
    Toolchain from http://tinyprod.net/repos/debian

**************************************************************************************

This brief is written assuming that there is a common root directory,
we'll call it "top" and it is usually at the top level of a working
directory.  ie.  ~/top.   You can put this directory anywhere, environment
variables are used to tell the tools where things live.

Most commands are entered from a terminal window.

**************************************************************************************

1) OS Install.

Development is only supported on Linux hosts, in particular the Ubuntu and/or Debian
strains.  Ubuntu 13.10 has been directly tested (on ASUS i7 quad core).

Obtain an ISO image from releases/ubuntu.com or alternatively from tinyprod.net/downloads.
Put the iso on to a bootable media (dvd or usb stick).  You can also use grub loopback 
for installation on an exiting Linux installation.  (Actual how to is beyond the scope
of this document).  A simple install is fine and will take less time.

When the install is complete, boot the system, and use "apt-get" to install the following
packages:

    build-essential stow automake autoconf libtool libc6-dev
    git-core git-daemon-run git-doc git-email git-gui gitk gitmagic
    openssh-client openssh-server

    python3 python3-serial python python-serial

The following will do the trick:

sudo -s
apt-get install build-essential stow automake autoconf libtool libc6-dev
apt-get install git-core git-daemon-run git-doc git-email git-gui gitk gitmagic
apt-get install openssh-client openssh-server
apt-get install python3 python3-serial python python-serial
exit


**************************************************************************************

2) Install the TinyOS toolset (msp430) (or other appropriate toolchain)

We want the tinyos toolset for msp430 based motes (ie, telosb, msp430f1611). Debian packages
are available from Stanford and tinyprod.net.   The toolchain at tinyprod.net as of
(May 25, 2014) is more up to date.

We want the following packages:

           nesc
	   tinyos-tools

        dependent on what toolchain you are using:
	   mspdebug
           msp430-46
           msp430-binutils-46
           msp430-gcc-46
	   msp430-gdb-46
           msp430-libc-46
	   msp430mcu-46

You want to follow the instructions at: http://tinyprod.net/repos/debian.

The following should be equivilent.

#
# add the repositories signing key to APT's keyring.  Needed to verify the repository
#
wget -O - http://tinyprod.net/repos/debian/tinyprod.key | sudo apt-key add -


#
# teach dpkg/apt-get/aptitude about where to find the tinyprod tools repository
#
sudo -s
echo "deb http://tinyprod.net/repos/debian squeeze main"   >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tinyprod-debian.list
echo "deb http://tinyprod.net/repos/debian msp430-46 main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tinyprod-debian.list
apt-get update
apt-get install nesc tinyos-tools msp430-46 mspdebug
exit

3) TinyOS 2.x tree checkout

GIT is used to manage the TinyOS trees.   These trees are held in git
repositories.  You should read 00c_Getting_Started_Git for details.

There are several repositories of note for TinyOS 2.1.2+.  You should choose
the one that makes the most sense for what you are working on.   These
repositories are all related and pains have been taken to track appropriately.

gh:tinyos/tinyos-main(master): This is the main development repository.
While typically stable it should be considered bleeding edge.

gh:tinyos/tinyos-release.git: This repository contains release points for the
main tinyos releases.  It is always stable.  The current default branch will
always point at the most current release.

gh:tinyprod/prod(tp-master): This repository is a superset of the main tinyos
repository.  It has stable additions that have not as of yet been integrated
into the main tinyos development threads.  Its current primary feature is
additional support for more modern TI MSP430 processors.  See 00a_Repo_Notes
for details.  It actively tracks the main tinyos development repository.

gh:tp-freeforall/prod(tp-master): This repository tracks gh:tinyprod/prod and
is essentiall the tip of tinyprod development.  It actively tracks the main
tinyos development repository.



For example, below we check out of the tip of the main development repository,
gh:tinyos/tinyos-main(master).

This gives you a read-only copy of the master branch of the tinyos/tinyos-main
repository.   It is a fully functional local repository that can be commited 
into (locally only).

    cd ~/top
    mkdir tinyos-main
    cd tinyos-main
    git clone -o tos -v git://github.com/tinyos/tinyos-main tinyos-2.x
    cd tinyos-2.x
    git checkout -b <your_initials>

    # note the remote will be called "tos"


>>>>>>>

Note: To get the current tinyos release (currently, tinyos-2_1_2) you should
use the following:

    cd ~/top
    mkdir tinyos-release
    cd tinyos-release
    git clone -o rel -v git://github.com/tinyos/tinyos-release tinyos-2.x
    cd tinyos-2.x
    git checkout -b <your_initials>

    # note the remote will be called "rel".

<<<<<<<


This will create a new branch named <your_intials> and will place you on
that branch. It will be branched off of the main branch of the remote,
gh:tinyos/tinyos-main(master).

This will keep your changes locally grouped.   You will have a remote named
'tos' (or 'rel') that points at the repository that you cloned,
git://github.com/tinyos/tinyos-main (git://github.com/tinyos/tinyos-release).
Your branch <your_initials> will be rooted at the default branch of the
repository.

To set up for contibuting to the main repository, see 00b_Using the Repo.

**************************************************************************************

4) Set up build environment settings

The following environment variables must be set to build.

    TOSROOT
    TOSDIR
    MAKERULES
    CLASSPATH

    for example:  working dir ~/top
  
  	#!/bin/sh
  
  	MOTECOM="serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:telosb"
  
  	TOSROOT=~/top/t2_cur/tinyos-2.x
  	TOSDIR=$TOSROOT/tos
  
  	MAKERULES=$TOSROOT/support/make/Makerules
  	CLASSPATH=.:$TOSROOT/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar
  
  	PYTHONPATH=$TOSROOT/support/sdk/python:$PYTHONPATH
  
  	export MAKERULES TOSDIR TOSROOT CLASSPATH PYTHONPATH
  	export MOTECOM


**************************************************************************************

5) Do a test compile.

    For telosb hardware:  (assumes pluged in to a USB port)

    cd ~/top/t2_cur/tinyos-2.x/apps/Blink
    make telosb install

    The Leds should start to blink.


**************************************************************************************

6) Build SerialForwarder and libmote library.   (optional)

WARNING:  This should get replaced with libmotenet.   Superset of the SF but also
allows using AM sockets or IPv6 sockets for connections.  Note: currently libmotenet
is a work in progress and should be considered experimental.


    Build the serial forwarder and associated library (also includes direct serial access)

      cd $TOSROOT/support/sdk/c/sf
      ./bootstrap
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/stow/sf_c
      make

      sudo -s
      make install

      ("sudo make install" for some reason doesn't pick up the value of $TOSROOT properly so
      the make install doesn't work write unless you are root first)

      This will install bin/{sf, sflisten, sfsend, seriallisten, serialsend}, include/{message.h,
      serialsource.h, sfsource.h}, and lib/libmote.a.  These will be installed into /opt/stow/sf_c.


   Install into /opt/{bin,include,lib} using stow.

      cd /opt/stow
      stow sf_c
